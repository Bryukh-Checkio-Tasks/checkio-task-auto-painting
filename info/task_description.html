    Nicola have built the semi-automatized painting system. But this system can paint only one side of the detail,
    after it an operator must rotate the detail and start painting for the other side.
    The painting process always ahs the same time. The camera can paint <strong>K</strong> details at one time.
    Nicola wants to use Stephan for serving of the painting system. For it he should develop the algorithm for Stephan,
    that allows to paint <strong>N</strong> (0 < N < 10) details for the shortest time.

    The details have numbers from 0 to 9. You are given capacity of the painting system (K) and quantity of details (N).
    You should return the sequence of painting as a string, where each action is the numbers of the painted details.
    Actions are separated by comma (",").

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Capacity of the painting system (K) and quantity of details (N). Integers.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The sequence of actions, a string.
