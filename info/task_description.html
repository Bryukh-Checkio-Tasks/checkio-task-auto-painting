    Nicola has built a semi-automatized painting system. But this system can paint only one side of an item,
    after it an operator must reload the item and start painting the other side (the system detects sides automatically).
    The painting process always takes the same amount of time. The camera can paint <strong>K</strong> surfaces at a time.
    Nicola wants Stephan to operate the painting system. That's why he should develop an algorithm for Stephan,
    that allows him to paint <strong>N</strong> (0 < N < 10) surfaces in the shortest possible timeframe.
    Be careful and don't load the item more than two times.

<p>
    The items have numbers from 0 to 9. You are given capacity of the painting system (K) and quantity of items (N).
    You should return the sequence of painting as a string, where each action is the numbers of the painted items.
    Actions are separated by comma (",").

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Capacity of the painting system (K) and quantity of items (N). Integers.

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The sequence of actions, a string.

    This is a simple example of how to use graph searching for the optimization problem.
